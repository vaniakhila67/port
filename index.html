            <p>A brief description of Project 1.</p>
            <p>The BMI Calculator is a simple web-based tool designed to help users quickly determine their Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.

In addition to calculating BMI, the tool also offers personalized suggestions on food, diet, and sleep habits to help users improve or maintain their health.</p>
